			<h1>Mushroom Radio</h1>
			<p>Mushroom Radio is a student run radio station from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. Initiated with the intention of creating a platform for expression and communication from within the student community.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The radio station, initiated by KABK alumni <span class="highlight">Jack Bardwell</span>, <span class="highlight">Ben Earl</span> and <span class="highlight">Esther Vane</span> was set up as a research tool that eventually developed into a platform for students to use and discuss topics as they will.</p>

			<h1>Burst</h1>
			<p>Mushroom Radio presents 'Burst ep. 1', where four KABK students each invite someone from outside of KABK (and outside of the art world!) to have a group discussion and a conversation about a certain topic. This friday the topic will be 'Artistic practice as a job.' <br>Expect fresh new insights, insecure KABK students, commercial strategy, a plea for laziness & dope tunes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Next Broadcast Friday 26/02/2021 | 13:00–14:30CET</p>

We meet once a fortnight to share reference, experience and ideas. In the process we are creating an alternative space for learning from each other within the institution.</p>
