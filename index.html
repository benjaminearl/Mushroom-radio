			<h1>Mushroom Radio</h1>
			<p>Mushroom Radio is a student run radio station from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. Initiated with the intention of creating a platform for expression and communication from within the student community.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The radio station, initiated by KABK alumni <span class="highlight">Jack Bardwell</span>, <span class="highlight">Ben Earl</span> and <span class="highlight">Esther Vane</span> was set up as a research tool that eventually developed into a platform for students to use and discuss topics as they will.</p>
